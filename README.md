# Disney Movie GIF Search

This app uses AJAX and JQuery to call Disney-themed GIFs from the GIPHY library. When the user clicks a button, the name of the movie is put inside the URL to find all the GIFs related to that Disney Movie's title.

The GIFs turn on and off when the user clicks the GIF. To achieve this, I included calls for a still image and an animated image from GIPHY. Each click switches which one is called.

The user can also add a button to the page using the form in the upper righthand corner. The "submit" button creates a button with the value of the Disney movie.
